Pretrained models associated with the project: [https://github.com/bdvllrs/generalization-vision](https://github.com/bdvllrs/generalization-vision).

To load the model using gensim (tried with gensim version 4.0.1 on python 3.8.5):

```python
import gensim

model = gensim.models.Word2Vec.load(model_path)
```
